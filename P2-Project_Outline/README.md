### Overview
A great deal of small nonprofit organizations struggle with the ability to track donations as well as organize and maintain their constituents. Lacking a budget for a proper database or CRM solution, many of these nonprofits opt for solutions as simple as a spreadsheet. 
Simple CRM will allow these nonprofits to gain better control over their donor and transactional data, offering a user-friendly front-end to navigate and maintain their critical data.

This idea was inspired by my own experiences working in the nonprofit fundraising and CRM field. I've been fortunate enough to work for larger, well-established nonprofits, but my time in the industry has exposed me to the needs of much smaller nonprofits that still do great work.
